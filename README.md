Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This webpage shows how to manage having an online brand.
It shows how to market and advertise which helps get your foot through the door.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I added a title for the webpage.
Added semantic elements so that it was more ogranized.
Added alt attributes to img sources.
Had to mess with where the <content> elements were because it wasn't working in bottom half of it.
Uploaded files to Github
